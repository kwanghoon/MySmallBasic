1. Install SQLite on Windows

•	Step 1 − Go to SQLite download page, and download precompiled binaries from Windows section. ( Link: 
https://www.sqlite.org/download.html ) 
•	Step 2 − Download sqlite-tools-win32-*.zip and sqlite-dll-win32-*.zip zipped files.
•	Step 3 − Create a folder C:\>sqlite and unzip above two zipped files in this folder, which will give you sqlite3.def, sqlite3.dll (in 
sqlite-dll-win32-*.zip) and sqlite3.exe files (in sqlite-tools-win32-*.zip).

2. Java with SQLite embedded database

To start using SQLite in Java programs, you need to make sure that you have SQLite JDBC Driver and Java set up on the machine.  
Now, let us check how to set up SQLite JDBC driver. In MySmallBasic, we did it for you. But we still leave the following guide just in case 
you want to do it again manually. 

•	Step 1: Download latest version of sqlite-jdbc-(VERSION).jar from sqlite-jdbc repository.
(Link: https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/downloads/)
•	Step 2: Add downloaded jar file sqlite-jdbc-(VERSION).jar in your class path:
For example, after step 1 we have the file downloaded:  sqlite-jdbc-3.21.0.jar.
Now copy file sqlite-jdbc-3.21.0.jar into folder MySmallBasic\lib. Done!
